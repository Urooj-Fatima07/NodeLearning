# Node.js Learning Repository
This repository contains basic examples and commands related to Node.js. I have explored and practiced different aspects of Node.js, including modules, file operations, and system-related commands.

## Modules Covered:
### CommonJS Module Syntax: 
Using require() to import modules and module.exports to export functionality.
### OS Module:
Used to interact with the operating system, including fetching system details like architecture, memory usage, and uptime.
### Path Module:
Used for working with and manipulating file and directory paths.
